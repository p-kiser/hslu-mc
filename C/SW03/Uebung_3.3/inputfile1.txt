# Le Pétomane

Le Pétomane (/ləˈpɛtəmeɪn/, French pronunciation: [ləpetɔˈman]) was the
stage name of the French flatulist (professional farter) and entertainer
Joseph Pujol (June 1, 1857 – 1945). He was famous for his remarkable
control of the abdominal muscles, which enabled him to seemingly fart
at will. His stage name combines the French verb péter, "to fart" with
the -mane, "-maniac" suffix, which translates to "fartomaniac". The
profession is also referred to as "flatulist", "farteur", or "fartiste".

It is a common misconception that Joseph Pujol actually passed
intestinal gas as part of his stage performance. Rather, Pujol was able
to "inhale" or move air into his rectum and then control the release of
that air with his anal sphincter muscles. Evidence of his ability to
control those muscles was seen in the early accounts of
demonstrations of his abilities to fellow soldiers.
